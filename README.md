LED Blink

This repository contains a simple Arduino code snippet for blinking an LED using an Arduino UNO microcontroller. The code demonstrates the basic usage of digital pins and the delay function to create a blinking effect.

Overview:
- The code is written in C++ and compatible with the Arduino platform.
- It uses pin 13 on the Arduino UNO board to control an LED.
- The LED turns on for a short duration, followed by an equal duration of being off, creating a blinking effect.
- The code is implemented in the setup() and loop() functions.
- The setup() function is called once at the beginning to set the LED pin as an output.
- The loop() function contains the main logic and is executed repeatedly.

Usage:
1. Connect the positive leg (longer leg) of an LED to pin 13 on the Arduino UNO board.
2. Connect the negative leg (shorter leg) of the LED to the ground (GND) pin on the Arduino UNO board.
3. Upload the code to the Arduino UNO board using the Arduino IDE or any other compatible software.
4. The LED connected to pin 13 will start blinking, turning on and off at equal intervals.

Feel free to modify the code to customize the blinking pattern or experiment with different pins and components. Happy tinkering!

Note: This code is specifically designed for the Arduino UNO board. If you are using a different board or microcontroller, you may need to make necessary modifications to the code.
